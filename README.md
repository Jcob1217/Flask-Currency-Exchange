# Flask-Currency-Exchange
A currency exchange website in Python using Flask.

It's basic currency exchange website model that lets user create an account add funds to it and then exchange it to other currencies than added. 
It also contains all most popular world currencies rates in PLN.

I've created this project to improve my skills in backend development.
I've used Flask and Python for handling all the website backend and also sqlalchemy for website database.
